            Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Matt Harrington,
            and I am currently a Computer Science major at Francis Marion University.
            I love all types of technology, and working with it.
            Over the past fifteen years of my twenty-two year
            old life, I have been thankful enough to be exposed to technology
            that has changed my life for the better.
          </p>

          <p>

            Since I was in elementary school, I have loved mathematics. Over the years,
            this passion of science and numbers lead me to pursure a field of engineering.
            The coolest part was that I had a piece of tech in my hands all of those years as well.
            This lead to me making a decison to pursue a computer science degree.
          </p>

          <p>

            Since making that declaration, I have been driven, since day one, to
            give college my absolute 100%. From the first day of my freshman year,
            until the last exam, I have and will give it my all. I want to do more
            than what is accepted. I want to work harder than the norm, and deliver
            myself a life I have always dreamed about.
          </p>

            For many, many years, photography has been my favorite, and most important hobby. I truly love it, and have created a small business with it for myself.
            I am self-taught, but it comes from my grandfather. He loved photography while I was growing up, and it translated over to a love for life within myself.
            He helped me with equiptment, and learning how to capture a photo before the shutter is even opened. He gave me my eye, and that is the most important part.
            The rest are just tools that can further help a photo's quality, but this is the basis of my ideology. I beleive that the most important
            part of any process comes from within; the rest is just a tool. My hobbies have benefited to so much in my life and I would not be the person
            I am today within my life going exactly how it has gone.

            My grandparents showed me an old video they recorded of me when I was four to five years old.
            I was amazed at the fact that I had a disposible camera in one hand, and a fake cell phone in the other.
            That was how I grew up. Like most computer science majors, that I have met anyways, I played a lot of video games when I was younger.
            I grew out of playing games a few years ago, but being exposed to the world had a lending hand on my life.
            Some of my most vivid memories however have been with other forms of technology. I got my first iPod Touch in 2008, and that
            experiance amazed in every way. This lead to my love for this field.

            I wanted a Mac to make applications for the iPod when I was twelve years old. At the time, that was so much money, but my grandfather
            purchased me a Mac Mini, and I instantly got involved. At the time of course I was overwhelmed, but my passion has always been there.
            Between watching every WWDC conference and video Apple put out from their sessions, to free iTunes U lectures, I wanted to be
            a software engineer from a young age. A dream hopefully becoming true.

            In 2013 my love for music pushed me to learn how to play an instrument.
            I decided that an acoustic guitar was too hard because it hurt my fingers, but I wanted to rock out regardless.
            I bought a bass, and have been self taught since. I had to work hard, but like everything else in life
            hard work paid off. It is a safe place to get
            my mind into, just playing note after note. I believe that the algorithmic
            patterns, and precision is something that benefited me more than just
            aggrevating my family at night.
